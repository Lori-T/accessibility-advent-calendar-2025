<p class="govuk-body">
  Santa’s logistics team share updates through a dashboard of important links.
  Unfortunately, several of the links just say “click here”, which is not very helpful.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that link text makes sense out of context and clearly describes the destination
  or action.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>scan the page for links that say things like “click here” or “more”</li>
  <li>check whether the link text alone explains what will happen</li>
  <li>if it does not, consider rewriting the link text</li>
  <li>avoid repeating the same link text for different destinations</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test the Santa logistics links</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a list of links used by Santa’s logistics team. There is a deliberate
  accessibility issue: several links use the same vague wording.
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list">
  <li>
    Reindeer flight schedule -
    {# ❌ Deliberate issue: vague link text #}
    <a href="#" class="govuk-link">click here</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Toy factory maintenance log -
    <a href="#" class="govuk-link">click here</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    View weather conditions for Christmas Eve -
    <a href="#" class="govuk-link">view</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Check toy quality control results -
    <a href="#" class="govuk-link">more</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-2">
  Imagine using a screen reader shortcut that lists links out of context - “click here”,
  “click here”, “view”, “more”. It is not clear which link does what.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The WCAG 2.2 skill behind this</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.4.4 link purpose (in context)</strong> - the purpose of each link should
  be clear from its text, or from its text together with nearby context.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Clear link text helps everyone scan a page quickly. It is especially important for
  people who use screen readers or voice input, and people with some cognitive impairments.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  On one of your own pages, copy and paste just the links into a list. Would they still
  make sense without the surrounding paragraphs?
