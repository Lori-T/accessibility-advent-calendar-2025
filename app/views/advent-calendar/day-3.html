<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 3: Check headings in the Workshop Log</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This morning, the <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> received an alert from
  Santa’s Workshop. The digital <strong>Workshop Log</strong>, used by elves across
  multiple teams, has become difficult to navigate.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Some sections look like headings but are not marked up correctly.
  Others jump between levels, making the page confusing for people who rely on
  assistive technology.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that headings follow a clear and logical structure.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>there should only be one <code>h1</code> on a page</li>
  <li>heading levels must not be skipped</li>
  <li>headings should describe the content that follows</li>
  <li>visual styling should not replace proper HTML headings</li>
</ul>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Examine the Workshop Log</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified extract from the Workshop Log.
  One heading has been marked up incorrectly.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"
     style="background:#f7f7f7; border-radius:8px;">

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Toy production</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The toy production team is currently working at full capacity.
    Several new toy designs have entered the assembly phase.
  </p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
    ❌ Production schedule
  </h4>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This week’s schedule includes extended shifts and additional quality checks.
    Materials are arriving later than planned.
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">✔ Materials and supplies</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Stock levels are stable. Replacement parts for wooden toys have been reordered
    and are expected to arrive by the end of the week.
  </p>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>1.3.1 info and relationships</strong> - content structure must be conveyed
  programmatically, not just visually.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Screen reader users often navigate pages using headings.
  If the structure is incorrect, content can feel disorganised or impossible to follow.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Finding this issue using the Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE</a> is run on a page like this,
  it highlights heading structure issues such as skipped levels or missing headings.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE can help you spot structural problems quickly, but it cannot tell you whether
  the heading order makes sense for users.
</p>

     style="width: 25%; border-radius: 8px;">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use your browser’s accessibility tree or a screen reader to navigate by headings only.
  Does the page flow in a way that makes sense?
