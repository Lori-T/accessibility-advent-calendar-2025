<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">About the Elf-cessibility induction at Santa HQ</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The <strong>Elf-cessability induction from the Department of Elfish Affairs*</strong> is a practical training
  resource designed to build confidence and capability in digital accessibility.
  It uses short, focused tasks based on real issues commonly found in live services.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  It's <strong>not</strong> designed to make you an accessibility expert, or as a replacement for proper accessibility auditing and user testing.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  *Unfortunately the Department of Elfish Affairs (DEA) is not a real government department. However, the accessibility
  challenges presented in this induction are based on real issues found in digital
  services used by millions of people every day.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who this training is for</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The Elf-cessability induction is for anyone involved in creating, publishing
  or maintaining digital services, including:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>content designers and writers</li>
  <li>interaction and service designers</li>
  <li>developers and engineers</li>
  <li>product managers and delivery teams</li>
  <li>researchers and accessibility specialists</li>
  <li>anyone responsible for digital quality</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What the induction covers</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The induction is structured as a series of <strong>12 short accessibility tasks</strong>.
  Each task focuses on a specific, common accessibility issue that can be checked
  quickly using a browser, keyboard or simple testing tools.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Across the 12 tasks, you will practise checking:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>keyboard access and focus visibility</li>
  <li>link purpose and meaningful text</li>
  <li>form labels and accessible names</li>
  <li>colour contrast and text resizing</li>
  <li>ARIA usage and semantic HTML</li>
  <li>responsive layouts and reflow</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each task includes:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a short scenario set in Santa HQ</li>
  <li>a clear accessibility problem to identify</li>
  <li>a relevant WCAG 2.2 success criterion</li>
  <li>a bonus challenge for deeper exploration</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Tools used during the induction</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Some tasks introduce a browser-based testing tool known as the
  <strong>'Web Accesibility Viewer for Elves'</strong> or more commonly known as WAVE.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE highlights potential accessibility issues such as missing labels,
  structural problems and colour contrast failures.
  It is useful for quick checks, but it does not replace manual testing.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Throughout the induction, you will learn when tools like WAVE are helpful,
  and when human judgement and manual testing are essential.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can install WAVE from the
  <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE website</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Completing the induction</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Once you have worked through all 12 tasks, you can finish the induction and
  receive your <strong>Elf-cessability Specialist</strong> badge and certificate.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  These are intended as a light-hearted recognition of progress - and a reminder
  that accessibility is an ongoing practice, not a one-off exercise.
