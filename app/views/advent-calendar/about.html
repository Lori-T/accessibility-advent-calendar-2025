  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Accessibility Advent Calendar is a fun and practical way to learn about digital accessibility throughout December. Each day reveals a quick accessibility tip that you can complete in under five minutes. These small checks help build good habits and make digital content more inclusive for everyone.

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The 2025 edition focuses on <strong>25 accessibility checks you can do in under 5 minutes</strong>. These are simple, repeatable activities that anyone can try, regardless of technical confidence.
