<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 6: Check focus visibility in the Reindeer Health Monitor</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The <strong>Reindeer Health Monitor</strong> is used by Santa HQ to keep track of
  each reindeer’s wellbeing during the busiest time of year. Some elves have reported
  losing their place when navigating the system using only a keyboard.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you will check whether it is always clear which element is currently selected
  as you move through the page using the keyboard.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that all interactive elements show a clear and visible focus indicator.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move through the page</li>
  <li>use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move backwards</li>
  <li>check that focus is always visible and easy to spot</li>
  <li>focus must not rely on colour alone</li>
  <li>pay close attention to custom styled buttons and controls</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Focus visibility issues are best found using manual testing.
  Automated tools such as the <strong>Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)</strong>
  are not reliable for checking focus visibility.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test the Reindeer Health Monitor</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  This simplified example shows part of a reindeer’s health record.
  One control works with the keyboard but does not show a visible focus indicator.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"
     style="background:#ffffff; border-left: 5px solid #1d70b8; max-width: 640px;">

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">
    Blitzen’s health record
  </h3>

  <div class="govuk-button-group">

    <!-- GOOD: real GOV.UK button + GOV.UK focus style -->
    <button class="govuk-button" type="button">
      <span aria-hidden="true">✔</span> Reindeer feeling festive
    </button>

    <!-- BAD: looks like a button, works on keyboard, but focus is hidden -->
    <button
      type="button"
      class="govuk-button"
      style="
        background:#d4351c;
        border-color:#d4351c;
        color:#ffffff;
      "
      onfocus="this.style.outline='none'; this.style.boxShadow='none';"
      onclick="alert('Uh oh! Blitzen is feeling grumpy, feed him some snacks 🦌')">
      <span aria-hidden="true">✖</span> Reindeer feeling grumpy
    </button>

  </div>

  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-3">
    One of these buttons can be activated using the keyboard, but it does not show where focus is when tabbing to it.
  </p>

</div>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.4.7 focus visible</strong> – users must be able to see which element
  currently has keyboard focus.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Keyboard users rely on visible focus to understand where they are on a page.
  If focus is missing or unclear, users can become disoriented or unable to
  complete tasks.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Zoom the page to 200 percent and then 400 percent and repeat the keyboard test.
  Is the focus indicator still easy to see?
</p>
