<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 1: Spot missing alt text on Santa’s photo feed</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  As part of your induction into the <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> (DEA),
  you've been assigned to Santa HQ to help with this year's festive accessibility review.
  With Christmas Eve fast approaching, the DEA must make sure every digital system
  the elves rely on is accessible to all users.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you're assessing the new <strong>North Pole photo feed</strong>,
  which shows images captured during Santa’s test flights. The elves need your help
  checking whether these images are accessible - especially for people who use screen readers.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that every meaningful image has an appropriate text alternative.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>look at each image and decide whether it is meaningful or decorative</li>
  <li>for meaningful images, check they have clear, concise <strong>alt text</strong></li>
  <li>for decorative images, check they use <code>alt=""</code></li>
  <li>make sure any text shown inside an image appears as real text elsewhere</li>
  <li>icons used as links or buttons must have an accessible name</li>
</ul>

  Below is a simplified version of the North Pole photo feed.
  One image has a deliberate accessibility issue.

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-1">
      ✔ Correct alt text.

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-1">
      ❌ <strong>Accessibility issue:</strong> missing alt text.  
      Screen readers will not announce this image.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-third govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
    <img src="{{ asset_path }}images/sleigh-flight.jpg"
         alt=""
         style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-1">
      ⚠ Decorative image: correctly marked with <code>alt=""</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Finding this issue using the special elf testing tool</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The elves often use their special testing tool to help spot image accessibility issues.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When the tool is run on a page like this, it highlights images that are missing
  alternative text or have empty <code>alt</code> attributes.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This can help you find potential problems quickly, but it is still important to
  review each image yourself and decide whether the text alternative makes sense
  for the information being shown.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>1.1.1 non-text content</strong> - meaningful images must have accessible alternatives.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Without alt text, people who are blind or have very low vision miss essential information.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Compare what you noticed visually with what a testing tool or screen reader reports.
  Do they highlight the same issue?
</p>
