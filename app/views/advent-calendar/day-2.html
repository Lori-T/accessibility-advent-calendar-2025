<p class="govuk-body">
  Santa HQ has released early tracking data, and you are one of the testers.
  Before it is approved for Christmas Eve, your job is to check whether the page works
  for people who rely on a keyboard instead of a mouse or trackpad.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that every interactive element – links, buttons, menus and panels – can be reached
  and operated using only the keyboard.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>click near the top of the page to set a starting point</li>
  <li>press <strong>Tab</strong> to move forwards through interactive elements</li>
  <li>press <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> to move backwards</li>
  <li>make sure nothing is skipped or unreachable</li>
  <li>check that all controls can be activated using <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Space</strong></li>
  <li>check you never get “stuck” inside a component or panel</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test the Santa tracker info panel</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified “info panel” that the elves are developing.
  It contains a deliberate accessibility issue: once you open it,
  you cannot close it using the keyboard.
</p>

<a href="#santa-panel" class="govuk-link govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
  Open Santa tracker info panel
</a>

<div id="santa-panel"
     class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-top-3"
     style="padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #d4351c;">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    🎅 Santa's sleigh reached 14,500 mph during last night's test flight.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    ❌ <strong>Accessibility issue:</strong> this panel cannot be closed using the keyboard.
    You can only close it with a mouse.
  </p>

  {# Deliberate issue: close “button” is a span, not focusable, not operable with keyboard #}
  <span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 10px; color: #b30000; cursor: pointer;">
    Close panel ✖
  </span>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The WCAG 2.2 skill behind this</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.1.1 keyboard</strong> – everything must be operable using the keyboard.<br>
  <strong>2.1.2 no keyboard trap</strong> – users must be able to move focus into
  and out of components.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Many people rely entirely on the keyboard. If controls cannot be reached or activated,
  the service becomes unusable. Broken keyboard support also affects people using
  assistive technologies like switch devices or voice recognition.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  After opening the panel, try to continue tabbing through the rest of the page.
  Does focus behave as you expect, or does it jump or disappear?
</p>
