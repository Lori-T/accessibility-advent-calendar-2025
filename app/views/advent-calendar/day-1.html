<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 2: Check colour contrast on the Elves’ control panel</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  As part of your ongoing work with the <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> (DEA),
  you have been asked to review part of the <strong>Elves’ control panel</strong>.
  Some elves have reported that parts of the panel are difficult to read during long shifts
  in the workshop.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you are checking whether text and controls on the panel have enough contrast
  to be readable for everyone, including people with low vision or colour vision differences.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that text and interactive elements have sufficient colour contrast.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>body text must have a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5 to 1</strong></li>
  <li>large text must have a contrast ratio of at least <strong>3 to 1</strong></li>
  <li>buttons, links and form controls must also meet contrast requirements</li>
  <li>do not rely on colour alone to communicate important information</li>
  <li>use a contrast checker rather than judging by eye</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Examine the Elves’ control panel</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified section of the control panel.
  One example has a deliberate colour contrast issue.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4" style="background:#f3f2f1; border-radius:8px;">

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Workshop status</h3>

  <p style="color:#9b9b9b;">
    ❌ This text is too light against the background and does not meet minimum contrast requirements.
  </p>

  <p style="color:#0b0c0c;">
    ✔ This text has sufficient contrast and is easy to read.
  </p>

  <button class="govuk-button">
    ✔ Normal button (passes)
  </button>

  <button class="govuk-button" style="background:#f5c5c5; color:#c00;">
    ❌ Low contrast button (fails)
  </button>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>1.4.3 contrast (minimum)</strong> - text and controls must be readable against their background.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Poor colour contrast can make content difficult or impossible to read for people with
  low vision, colour vision deficiencies, or when using screens in bright or low light conditions.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Finding this issue using the Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE</a> is run on a page like this,
  it flags text and controls that may not meet colour contrast requirements.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE can quickly highlight potential contrast failures, but you should always confirm
  results using a colour contrast checker and consider the context of the content.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use a contrast checker to test the failing examples.
  What colour changes would make them pass?
