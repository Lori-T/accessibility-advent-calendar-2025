<p class="govuk-body">
  The elves have built a “present packing dashboard” to track gift wrapping progress.
  It looks festive, but some of the buttons lose their outline when you tab to them.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that it is always clear which element currently has keyboard focus.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use <strong>Tab</strong> and <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> to move around the page</li>
  <li>at each step, check you can clearly see where focus is</li>
  <li>make sure focus is not hidden behind colour alone (shape, border or outline all help)</li>
  <li>ensure focus is visible on links, buttons, form controls and custom components</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test the present packing dashboard</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a row of controls used by the elves. One of the buttons has a deliberate
  accessibility issue: the focus outline has been removed for aesthetic reasons.
</p>

<div class="govuk-button-group">

  <button class="govuk-button" type="button">
    Mark as wrapped
  </button>

  <button class="govuk-button govuk-button--secondary" type="button">
    Mark as delayed
  </button>

  {# ❌ Deliberate issue: inline style removes the focus outline #}
  <button class="govuk-button govuk-button--secondary"
          type="button"
          style="outline: none !important; box-shadow: none !important;">
    Mark as urgent
  </button>

</div>

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-3">
  Try tabbing through the buttons. Can you see focus on all three,
  or does one disappear?
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The WCAG 2.2 skill behind this</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.4.7 focus visible</strong> - keyboard focus must always be visible.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Users who navigate with the keyboard need a clear visual indicator of where they are.
  If focus is not visible, it is easy to activate the wrong control or lose track
  of progress on a page.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use your browser’s dev tools to temporarily remove the inline styles from the
  “Mark as urgent” button. How does the focus indicator change?
