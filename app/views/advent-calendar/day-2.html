<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 2: Check colour contrast on the Elves’ Control Panel</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Overnight, the <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> received a report from
  Santa’s workshop that parts of the <strong>Elves’ Control Panel</strong> are hard to read.
  Some elves say text blends into the background, particularly during early-morning shifts
  or when working in low light.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you are reviewing part of the Control Panel to learn how to check whether
  text and controls meet minimum colour contrast requirements.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Learn how to check that text and interactive elements have enough colour contrast
  to be readable.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>normal body text must have a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong></li>
  <li>large text (18px or larger, or 14px bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least <strong>3:1</strong></li>
  <li>text in buttons, links and form controls must also meet contrast requirements</li>
  <li>placeholder text often fails contrast and should be checked carefully</li>
  <li>do not rely on visual judgement alone when checking contrast</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Review the Elves’ Control Panel</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified section of the Control Panel showing examples of good and bad
  colour contrast.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4" style="background: #f1f1f1; border-radius: 8px;">

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Workshop status</h3>

  <p style="color: #9b9b9b;">
    ❌ This text is too light against the background and does not meet the minimum
    contrast ratio.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #333;">
    ✔ This text has sufficient contrast and is easier to read.
  </p>

  <button class="govuk-button" style="background:#c00; color:#fff;">
    ✔ Button with sufficient contrast
  </button>

  <button class="govuk-button" style="background:#f5c5c5; color:#c00;">
    ❌ Button with low contrast
  </button>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Finding this issue using the special elf testing tool</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The elves use the <strong>Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)</strong>
  to help identify colour contrast issues.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When WAVE is run on a page, it highlights text and controls that do not meet minimum
  contrast requirements and provides information about the contrast ratios used.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This can help you identify potential problems quickly, but it is still important to
  consider whether colour is being used in a way that is clear and usable for everyone.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>1.4.3 contrast (minimum)</strong>. Text must be readable against its background.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Poor colour contrast can make content difficult or impossible to read for people
  with low vision, colour vision deficiencies, or when screens are used in bright
  or low-light conditions.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use a contrast checker to test the failing examples above.
  What colour changes would make them pass?
</p>
