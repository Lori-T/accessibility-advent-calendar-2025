<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 6: Check focus visibility in the Reindeer Health Monitor</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The <strong>Reindeer Health Monitor</strong> is used by Santa HQ to keep track of
  each reindeer’s wellbeing during the busiest time of year. Some elves have reported
  losing their place when navigating the system using only a keyboard.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you will check whether it is always clear which element is currently selected
  when moving through the page using the keyboard.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that all interactive elements show a clear and visible focus indicator.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move through the page</li>
  <li>check that focus is always visible</li>
  <li>focus should be easy to see and not subtle</li>
  <li>focus must not rely on colour alone</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Test the Reindeer Health Monitor</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The section below contains one deliberate focus visibility issue.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4" style="background:#f7f7f7; border-radius:8px;">

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <a href="#" class="govuk-link">
      ✔ View Blitzen’s health record
    </a>
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <button class="govuk-button">
      ✔ Update feeding schedule
    </button>
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <button style="background:#e0e0e0; border:0; padding:10px 16px;">
      ❌ Record festive energy level
    </button>
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-hint">
    Try using the keyboard only. Is it always clear where focus is?
  </p>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.4.7 focus visible</strong> - users must be able to see which element
  currently has keyboard focus.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Keyboard users rely on visible focus to understand where they are on a page.
  If focus is missing or unclear, users can become disoriented or unable to
  complete tasks.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to check this</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Focus visibility issues are best found using manual testing.
  Automated tools such as the Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)
  are not reliable for checking focus visibility.
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the page</li>
  <li>check that focus is always clearly visible</li>
  <li>pay close attention to custom styled buttons and controls</li>
  <li>
      <a href="https://accessibility-advent.lorithomson.co.uk/advent-calendar/day-11" class="govuk-link">
      find out more about keyboard accessibility in last year’s advent calendar, Day 11
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Zoom the page to 200 percent and then 400 percent and repeat the keyboard test.
  Is the focus indicator still easy to see?
