<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 4: Check link purpose on the Naughty and Nice List Viewer</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> has been reviewing the
  <strong>Naughty and Nice List Viewer</strong>, a tool used by Santa’s team to
  review behaviour records from across the year.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  During testing, several elves reported that it was hard to understand where
  some links would take them. Many links use vague wording that only makes sense
  if you can see the surrounding content.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that links clearly describe their purpose.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>link text should describe the destination or action</li>
  <li>avoid vague text like <q>click here</q> or <q>more</q></li>
  <li>assume users may encounter links out of context</li>
  <li>surrounding text can help, but links should still be meaningful</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Examine the Naughty and Nice List Viewer</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified extract from the Naughty and Nice List Viewer.
  One link has a deliberate accessibility issue.
</p>

<div class="govuk-!-padding-4 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"
     style="background:#f7f7f7; border-radius:8px;">

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Eve Snowball</strong><br>
    Behaviour rating: Mostly nice<br>
    <a href="#">View Eve Snowball’s full behaviour record</a>
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Buddy the Elf</strong><br>
    Behaviour rating: Under review<br>
    <a href="#">Click here</a> ❌
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Holly Tinseltoe Frost</strong><br>
    Behaviour rating: Nice<br>
    <a href="#">View Peppermint Frost’s behaviour notes</a>
  </p>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>2.4.4 link purpose (in context)</strong> - users must be able to
  understand what a link does from its text or context.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Screen reader users often navigate by listing links on a page.
  If several links are called <q>click here</q>, it becomes impossible to tell
  them apart.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Finding this issue using the Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE</a> is run on a page like this,
  it can highlight links with vague or repeated text.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE helps flag potential problems, but you still need to decide whether the
  link text makes sense to users when read on its own.
</p>

     style="width: 25%; border-radius: 8px;">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use a screen reader or browser tool to view a list of all links on the page.
  Can you immediately tell what each link does?
