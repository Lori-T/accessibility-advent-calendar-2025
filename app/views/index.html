<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">The 12 days of accessibility at Santa HQ</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Welcome to the annual festive review led by the
  <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> (DEA). In the run-up to Christmas,
  the DEA carries out a series of quick accessibility checks across the systems
  used by Santa HQ, from the Workshop Log to the Reindeer Health Monitor.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This year, you have been recruited as an <strong>Elf-cessability Specialist</strong>.
  Each day, you will open a new door to uncover a short, practical task that helps
  make North Pole digital services more inclusive.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each task takes less than five minutes and focuses on a common accessibility issue
  found in real services. Some days you will spot issues by eye, and on other days
  you will use simple testing tools to help you.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The special elf testing tool</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The elves use a special testing tool called the
  <strong>Workshop Accessibility Verification Engine (WAVE)</strong>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE is a browser extension that highlights potential accessibility issues on a page,
  such as missing text alternatives, poor contrast, or structural problems.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can install the WAVE browser extension from the
  <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE website</a>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Automated tools like WAVE are helpful for finding issues quickly, but they do not
  catch everything. Throughout the 12 days, you will learn when tools are useful
  and when human judgement is essential.
</p>

<!-- <p class="govuk-body">
  By completing all 12 days, you will build the knowledge needed for your final
  assignment, reviewing the <strong>Record a Santa Sighting</strong> service.
  This is a full user journey with intentional accessibility issues to identify.
</p>

{% if (currentDay and currentYear == "2025" and currentDay <= 12) %}
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Today is <strong>Day {{ currentDay }}</strong>. Your next mission awaits.
  </p>
