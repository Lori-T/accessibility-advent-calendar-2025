  from keyboard access and focus visibility to ARIA misuse and link purpose.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What’s next?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Accessibility isn’t a one-off task - it’s something to build into everyday
  design, development and content decisions.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Take what you’ve learned here and try it out on real services:
  test with a keyboard, zoom the page, run WAVE, and - most importantly -
  think about real users and test with real elves (people) with disabilities to make sure things work.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Thanks for taking part, and happy testing 🎅
