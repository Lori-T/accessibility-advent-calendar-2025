<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 3: Check headings in the Workshop Log</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This morning, the <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> received an alert from
  Santa’s Workshop. The digital <strong>Workshop Log</strong>, used by elves across
  multiple teams, has become difficult to navigate.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Some sections look like headings but are not marked up correctly.
  Others jump between levels, making the page confusing for people who rely on
  assistive technology.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check that headings follow a clear and logical structure.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>there should only be one <code>h1</code> on a page</li>
  <li>heading levels must not be skipped</li>
  <li>headings should describe the content that follows</li>
  <li>visual styling should not replace proper HTML headings</li>
</ul>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Examine the Workshop Log</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Below is a simplified extract from the Workshop Log.
  One heading has been marked up incorrectly.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The example above contains a heading structure issue.
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        The page starts correctly with a single <code>h1</code>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The section heading <strong>“Toy production”</strong> is marked up as
        <code>h2</code>, which is appropriate.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>“Production schedule”</strong> is marked up as <code>h4</code>,
        which skips a heading level.
        <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">
          Heading levels must not be skipped. An h4 should not follow an h2.
        </span>
      </li>

      <li>
        The correct heading level for <strong>“Production schedule”</strong>
        would be <code>h2</code> as it appears the same importance as the others, or <code>h3</code> if it was less important.
      </li>

      <li>
        Skipped heading levels make it harder for screen reader users to
        understand the structure of the page.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>
</details>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">

  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">1.3.1 info and relationships (opens in a new tab)</a></strong> - content structure must be conveyed
  programmatically, not just visually.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Screen reader users often navigate pages using headings.
  If the structure is incorrect, content can feel disorganised or impossible to follow.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Finding this issue using the Web Accesibility Viewer for Elves (WAVE)
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE</a> is run on a page like this,
  it highlights heading structure issues such as skipped levels or missing headings.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  WAVE can help you spot structural problems quickly, but it cannot tell you whether
  the heading order makes sense for users.
</p>

     style="width: 25%; border-radius: 8px;">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Use your browser’s accessibility tree or a screen reader to navigate by headings only.
  Does the page flow in a way that makes sense?
