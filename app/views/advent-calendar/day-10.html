<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Day 10: Check captions on Santa’s video message</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each December, Santa records a short message for the elves using the
  <strong>Elf Communications Console</strong>. This year’s message has been uploaded
  to the dashboard, but some elves are struggling to access the information.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Today, you’ll check whether video content includes captions or an accessible
  alternative for people who cannot hear the audio.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your mission today</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Check whether Santa’s message includes captions or a transcript.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Quick 5-minute check</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>videos with speech must have captions</li>
  <li>captions should include spoken words and meaningful sounds</li>
  <li>a transcript can be provided as an alternative</li>
  <li>do not rely on auto-generated captions without checking accuracy</li>
  <li>
    automated tools such as the <strong>Web Accesibility Viewer for Elves (WAVE)</strong>
    can help identify media, but manual checks are essential
  </li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Finding this using the Web Accesibility Viewer for Elves (WAVE)</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  When <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" class="govuk-link">WAVE</a> is run on a page like this,
  it will flag that a video is present.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  However, WAVE cannot reliably tell whether a video has accurate captions or
  a suitable transcript. This means you must manually check the video itself.
</p>

<img
  src="{{ asset_path }}images/wave10.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the WAVE accessibility tool highlighting that a video is present on the page"
  style="width: 25%; border-radius: 8px;">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this checks for</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-prerecorded.html"
     class="govuk-link"
     target="_blank">
    1.2.2 captions (prerecorded) (opens in a new tab)
  </a>
  – prerecorded videos with speech must include captions or a suitable alternative.
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Captions make video content accessible to D/deaf and hard of hearing users.
  They also support users in noisy environments or situations where audio cannot
  be played.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">A note on audio description</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Audio description provides spoken descriptions of important visual information
  for people who cannot see the video. This includes things like actions,
  on-screen text, or visual cues that are not explained in the dialogue.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Not every video needs audio description. If all important visual information is
  already communicated through speech, captions alone may be sufficient.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Bonus challenge</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Mute the video or turn your sound off.
  How much of Santa’s message can you understand without captions?
