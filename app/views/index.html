<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">12 days of digital accessibility tips</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Welcome to the annual festive review led by the 
  <strong>Department of Elfish Affairs</strong> (DEA). In the run-up to Christmas,
  the DEA carries out a series of quick accessibility checks across the systems
  used by Santa HQ - from the Workshop Log to the Reindeer Health Monitor.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This year, you’ve been recruited as an <strong>Elf-cessability Specialist</strong>.  
  Each day, you'll open a new door to uncover a short, practical task that helps 
  make North Pole digital services more inclusive. Every task takes less than five minutes 
  and highlights a common accessibility issue found in real services.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  By completing all 12 days, you'll build the knowledge needed for your final 
  assignment: reviewing the <strong>Record a Santa Sighting</strong> service - a full 
  user journey with intentional accessibility issues to spot.
</p>

{% if (currentDay and currentYear == "2025" and currentDay <= 12) %}
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Today is <strong>Day {{ currentDay }}</strong>. Your next mission awaits.
